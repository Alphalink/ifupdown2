TODO:
====
- support for /etc/networking.defaults
- implement legacy ifupdown mapping feature
- support for the following ifupdown options:
    -o OPTION=VALUE     set OPTION to VALUE as though it were in
                        /etc/network/interfaces
    --no-mappings       don't run any mappings
    --no-scripts        don't run any hook scripts

- Fix parallel implementation
- Test all original ifupdown options for compatibility
- Test scale
- Test with ifupdown-extra, ifmetric, ifupdown-scripts-zg2
- export other environment variables to scripts:
	IFACE  physical name of the interface being processed
        LOGICAL logical name of the interface being processed
        ADDRFAM address family of the interface
        METHOD method of the interface (e.g., static)
        MODE   start if run from ifup, stop if run from ifdown
        PHASE  as per MODE, but with finer granularity, distinguishing the pre-
               up, post-up, pre-down and post-down phases.
        VERBOSITY indicates  whether --verbose was used; set to 1 if so, 0 if not.
        PATH   the  command   search   path:   /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:‚Äê
               /usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

- option to pretty print dependency graph. Also an option to output in dot format

- make inet, inet6 address handling smarter: query for existing addresses and
  decide
